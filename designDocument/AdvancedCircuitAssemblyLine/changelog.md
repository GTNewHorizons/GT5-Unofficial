# Guys, its a draft, I will clean this doc later. I better keep my though in raw for now.

## 2025 November 18:

I release in our test server the first implementation of the exotic circuit line
and the acal, for now the multi is a very simple 3 by 3 machines with backport of
barthwork circuits. the multi act like a macerator but process circuits.

- I wanted to gate entry to exotic line to MTO
- I also wanted to not use Datastick and assembly line to change the spice a bit
- I wanted to grind a bit with PICO circuit to unlock the acal
- I wanted to heavly gate the exotic mainframe to QGP


## 2025 November 23:

I've updated the advanced circuit assembly line to act like
the TMP, granting parallel as long as you have energy to sustains your actions.
This will lower to 1 the number of required acal through the game progression

- I also lowered MSO quantities for exotic recipes, but MSO is still wanted to be
  the gate of exotic line
- I remove barthwork circuit backport and use the normal one instead
- I also gated the structure to a good amount of dtpf materials.
- All circuit from the assline has been imported but only one craft is available for each circuits

I think after spacetime and 16 pico is a good place to unlock this multi.
My thoughts after testing is, the Space elevator may be a bottleneck for optical components. lets see

## 2025 November 26:

I added duration checkbox on the acal gui, to play a bit with the overclocking algorithm.
its fun but is it useful ?

## 2025 November 27:

The second batch of test found in the same situation of all endgame recipe, its time consuming
I need a lot of resources. Some adjustments have been made:

- Exotic super cpu spacetime wire and transcendent screw has been divided by 2
- Exotic processor, assembly and computer super cpu has been replaced by exotic circuit board x1
- OpticalCPUContainmentHousing has a craft using exotic circuit board and give x4 3sec.

## 2025 November 29:

Changed all circuit craft, now outputting Any circuit until UV, in my opinion
at this state of the progression, any circuits lower than optical should be free
terms of resources and time.
I introduce a cheapest recipe to cut these crafts using innovative circuit board.

## 2025 December 8:

I decided to add a new module to the PCB factory to craft cosmic and transcendent line
for now the multi does notting but is required to craft the board.
I recalculated the Any circuits recipe to be a better match than the current optimized recipe.
yeah its a buff.

## 2025 December 12:

Innovative and Universal SMDs has been release to add a new layer discount/crafting for the endgame circuits
Still in test but I think im lower the cost at some point.
The game could only be the voltage tier of the prass (currently umv).

I have drastically reduced the amount of DimensionallyShiftedSuperfluid for circuit crafting because
at some point (close to QuarkGluonPlasma) the amount became too crazy. possible but a not needed bottleneck
taking over (insanely clogging) 6 compact mk5 for MSO.
MSO amount has also been reduced for Exotic circuits.

## 2025 December 28:

I disable cosmic circuit recipe, im waiting for another french dev to implement something
i think useful rp speaking.
For exotics and Any circuit, recipe nerf, base recipe time is longer, that require
more eu to make circuits and its totally fair.
We confirmed the migration to mui2
we fix the gui issue for the side panel.
now the controller terminal write the used eu for the current recipe.

## 2025 December 31:

Any cosmic circuit and components has been deleted, the TFS also been deleted,
meaning any uv uhv and uev circuit has also been deleted.
We are at the end of the implementation and balance of the Exotic line and Any circuit from ULV to ZPM.
I changed some text and set default values that was most accurate to early UIV.
The inputted crafting duration now match with the recipe time.
Translation has been done.
Unused textures has been deleted.

2 Exotic processors are required to craft an Exotic Assembly.
Polish game and doc for PR.
