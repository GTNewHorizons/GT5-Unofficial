# introduction

GTRecipeBuilder is the replacement of GT_Values.RA.addXXXX for constructing and adding recipes.
Compared to the old style, this one utilizes the builder pattern to

1. allow greater flexibility in API.
2. allow us to unify the AssLine recipes and everything else
3. a much nicer syntax than an awfully long line, i.e. more readability

## metadata

this corresponds to the various int/long parameter on the old recipe adder interface.
See implosion compressor recipe map for a example on its usage.
the extension also made it possible to use more complicated value, however there is no such use case yet.

`LOW_GRAVITY` and `CLEANROOM` are common metadata that are supported in most recipe maps. They default to false, and is
required to be set to true if you want your recipe to have such restriction.

Other metadata used by the specific recipe maps MUST to be documented in some way, with javadoc on the recipe map field
being the preferred choice.

# Coding Conventions

## Metadata identifiers

1. naming uses snake case, e.g. `my_metadata_identifier`
2.

## complicated recipe adder

1. If one invocation of recipe adder would add multiple recipe to same recipe map, give that recipe map a recipeEmitter
2. If one invocation of recipe adder would conditionally add recipe, define a new IRecipeMap in GTRecipeConstants
3. If one invocation of recipe adder would add recipe to multiple recipe map,
   1. If all recipe maps involved receive recipe only via this type of adding, use the chaining mechanism offered by GTRecipeMap, i.e. addDownstream().

      e.g.sMultiblockElectrolyzerRecipes and sElectrolyzerRecipes
   2. Otherwise, define a new IRecipeMap in GTRecipeConstants.
4. If the target isn't a real recipe map (e.g. AssLine stuff), define a new IRecipeMap in GTRecipeConstants.

## Downstream in an addon

This assumes you need to generate recipe into your own recipe map from a parent recipe map.

## deep copy or not

There is no need to do deep copy EXCEPT you are downstream.
If you do modify the values in a downstream recipe map, call IRecipeMap.deepCopyInput() before adding yourself as a downstream.

## recipeTransformer or recipeEmitterSingle

Prefer recipeTransformer, unless it would throw exception on builder.build().

## Special Value and Special Item

These are considered legacy. IRecipeMap should avoid using these and use the more readable metadata system.

## Use recipe builder or add() directly inside IRecipeMap.doAdd()?

You SHOULD use the recipe builder and delegate further processing to the doAdd() on that recipe map. e.g. UniversalDistillation
However, there are situations that you need to bypass those logic. Then add() is a valid choice.

## Reassign builder variable

No. Just like StringBuilder, you should not do this. Builder is guaranteed to return itself, not a copy.

Reassigning wouldn't break anything though. This is a coding convention to help the code to stay organized.
