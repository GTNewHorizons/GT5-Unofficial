### Build
If you want a bleeding-edge version of this mod, you can simply download or clone this repository, establish a folder named "libs" and put the dev builds:
CodeChickenCore-1.7.10-1.0.7.47-dev.jar
CodeChickenLib-1.7.10-1.1.3.140-dev.jar

Then you can build this mod in the same way as building other mods. i.e. run "gradlew build" command in the CMD window. Then the build can be found in "./build/libs/" folder.
