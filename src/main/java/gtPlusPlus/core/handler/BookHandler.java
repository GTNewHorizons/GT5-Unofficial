                "To begin the building, lay out the first 3x3 layer of Machine Casings on the ground (with a Hatch in the Middle), then place the Boiler Block facing outward in the middle of one of the 3m wide Sides.",
                "Now grab 3 other Hatches and place them on the remaining three 3m wide Sides also facing outwards. And now the four corners of the Machine need also a Machine Casing. There should only be a Hole left in the middle of the Cube.",

                "When accessing the Boiler Block, it should now stop telling you, that the structure is incomplete (bottom Line of that Screen). Now go with a bunch of different Tools (Metal Hammer, Rubber Hammer, Screwdriver, Wrench, Soldering Iron and Crowbar)",
                "to the Maintenance Hatch and access it. After that you grab the 6 Tools and rightclick the Slot with each of them in your Hand in the Maintenance GUI. Note that you need Soldering Tin/Lead in your Inventory to use the Soldering Iron.",
                "The Main Block should now tell you that you need to use the Rubber Hammer on it to (re)activate the Machine. The Rubber Hammer can enable and disable Machines. The Machine disables itself after something important broke.",
                "If you want to use Lava with this Device, then you should add a Lava Filter to extract additional Resources from the Lava. If the Filter breaks, the Machine won't explode like a Turbine would. If you use molten Salt, then you won't need a Filter.",

                "To fix these Problems, just go to the Maintenance Hatch and click with the problem corresponding Tool on the Slot to repair. If all six possible runtime Problems happen, the Machine will auto-shutdown no matter what. No Explosion, it's just stopping.",

                "A Thermal Boiler is worth about 33 small Thermal Generators, and as the Boilers get much less Efficient, when not having enough Fuel, you should consider making a large Nether Pump for Lava, or a good Nuclear Reactor for molten Salt.",
                "Input and Output Slots are fully optional, you can place multiple ones of them or even none on the Machine. A Machine without Input couldn't process any Recipes, while a Machine without Output just voids all outputted Items and Liquids.",
